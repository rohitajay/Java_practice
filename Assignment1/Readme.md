1. Develop a java class with a method saveEvenNumbers(int N) using ArrayList to store even numbers from 2 to N, where N is an integer which is passed as a parameter to the method saveEvenNumbers().
The method should return the ArrayList (A1) created. 
In the same class create a method printEvenNumbers() which iterates through the arrayList A1 in step 1, and It should multiply each number with 2 and display it in format 4,8,12….2*N. and add these numbers in a new ArrayList (A2). 
The new ArrayList (A2) created needs to be returned.  Create a method printEvenNumber(int N) parameter is a number N. 
This method should search the arrayList (A1) for the existence of the number ‘N’ passed. If it exists it should return the Number else return zero.Hint: Use instance variable for storing the ArrayList A1 and A2. 
NOTE: You can test the methods using a main method.



2. Create an application for employee management having following classes: 
Create an Employee class with following attributes and behaviors : i) EmpId Int ii) EmpName String iii) EmpEmail String iv) EmpGender char v) EmpSalary float vi) GetEmployeeDetails() -> prints employee details
Create one more class EmployeeDB which has the following methods. i) boolean addEmployee(Employee e) ii) boolean deleteEmployee(int empId) iii) String showPaySlip(int empId) iv) Employee[] listAll()
Do implementation of the above application with below two methods : I. Use an ArrayList which will be used to store the employees and use enumeration/iterator to process the employees. II. Use a TreeSet Object to store employees on the basis of their EmpId and use enumeration/iterator to process employees. [Hint: Use Comparable interface] Write a Test Program to test that all functionalities are operational.




Create an ArrayList which will be able to store only Strings. Create a printAll method which will print all the elements using an Iterator.

Create an ArrayList which will be able to store only numbers like int,float,double,etc, but not any other data type.

Create an ArrayList of Employee( id,name,address,sal) objects and search for particular Employee object based on id number.

Implement the assignment 1 using Linked List



Implement the assignment 1 using Vector

Write a program that will have a Vector which is capable of storing emp objects. Use an Iterator and enumeration to list all the elements of the Vector.
